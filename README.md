# Impact of NIC on image classification

This project investigates how AI-based image compressionâ€”particularly neural image compression (NIC)â€”affects image classification performance. It evaluates the trade-off between compression efficiency and the retention of discriminative features across both general and task-specific datasets.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Traditional compression methods (e.g., JPEG) often sacrifice subtle features important for classification. This project compares conventional methods with state-of-the-art NIC models, focusing on their impact on downstream tasks like medical image diagnosis and license plate recognition.

## ðŸ§  Key Contributions
- Compared Cheng2020-anchor and Cheng2020-attn NIC models against JPEG using PSNR, SSIM, VIF, and BPP.
- Analyzed performance degradation in classification on compressed medical images (ISIC2018 dataset).
- Explored surprising improvements in OCR accuracy for license plate recognition after compression.

## ðŸ“Š Datasets
- Kodak â€“ Used for evaluating compression performance as a baseline.
- ISIC2018 â€“ Skin lesion classification with high-resolution medical images.
- US License Plates â€“ For OCR evaluation via PaddleOCR.

## ðŸ§ª Experiments Summary
**1. Classification**
- Classifier: DenseNet201 (pretrained and custom-trained)
- Task: Skin lesion classification (9-class)
- Datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nodoubttome/skin-cancer9-classesisic/data
- Pretrained model for test in experiments/AICompression.ipynb: https://www.kaggle.com/code/muhammadsamarshehzad/skin-cancer-classification-densenet201-99-acc/output
- Metric: Accuracy, F1 score, Cohenâ€™s Kappa
- Notable finding: Up to 20% drop in accuracy on compressed images vs original

**2. OCR on Compressed Images**
- OCR Tool: PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv3 pipeline)
- Finding: Compression (Q3) improved OCR in ~12.3% of cases
- Hypothesis: Compression smooths noise and enhances character clarity
